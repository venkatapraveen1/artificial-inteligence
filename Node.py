    A* search algorithm to find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node.

               and values are dictionaries of neighboring nodes with their
               corresponding costs (distances).  Example:
               graph = {
                   'A': {'B': 10, 'C': 15},
                   'B': {'A': 10, 'D': 12, 'E': 15},

               }
        start: The starting node (state).
        goal: The goal node (state).
        heuristic_func: A function that takes a node (state) as input and returns
                        an estimated cost (heuristic) to reach the goal from that node.
                        The heuristic function must be admissible (never overestimates
                        the actual cost).

    Returns:
        A tuple containing:
        - The path (list of nodes) from start to goal, or None if no path exists.
        - The total cost of the path, or None if no path exists.
